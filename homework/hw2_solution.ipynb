    "# Homework 2: Language in the 2016 Presidential Election\n",
    "Popular figures often have help managing their media presence.  In the 2016 election, Twitter was an important communication medium for every major candidate.  Many Twitter posts posted by the top two candidates were actually written by their aides.  You might wonder how this affected the content or language of the tweets.\n",

    "Along the way, you'll get a first look at Pandas.  Pandas is a Python package that provides a `DataFrame` data structure similar to the `datascience` package's `Table`, which you might remember from Data 8.  `DataFrame`s are a bit harder to use than `Table`s, but they provide more advanced functionality and are a standard tool for data analysis in Python."

Once you're done with your analysis, you may find it interesting to see whether `R` is easier to use for this task."

    "If you use bootstrap methods to compute a confidence interval for the proportion of Trump aide retweets from Android phones in \"the population of all @realDonaldTrump retweets,\" you will find that the interval is [0, 0].  That's because there are no retweets from Android phones by Trump aides in our dataset.  Is it reasonable to conclude from this that Trump aides definitely never tweet from Android phones?"
